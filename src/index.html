                are here.
              </h2>
              <p class="pt3 text-content square-content">
                Traditionally, cargo pants were designed by the US Military for paratroopers who literally had to jump
                out of a plane
                and be ready for battle as soon as they hit the ground. So we took that inspiration, and made it ready
                for the everyday
                man.
                <br><br>
                SWAT Pants are made for hiking, biking, white-water rafting, horseback riding, snowboarding, rock
                climbing, or crawling
                up a mountain on your hands and knees in Ecuador. When you’re done, you can parachute back into everyday
                life like a
                paratrooper, and be just as comfortable walking down the street.
                <br><br>
                Now that’s our idea of “versatile”.

              </h2>
              <p class="pt3 text-content square-content">
                When paratroopers land head-first into combat, they need to be able to reach supplies quickly, without
                even thinking
                about it. When the British military developed the first iteration of the cargo pant in 1938, it only had
                one big, square
                pocket. The Americans improved on that design a few years later with the addition of a few more pockets.
                <br><br>
                <strong>In 2019, we made SWAT Pants with NINE pockets.</strong>
                <br><br>
                There are two zipper side pockets, with two velcro side pockets for added security. There are also three
                rear pockets
                for additional supplies, as well as two deep and spacious crossover front pockets. There’s even a
                climbing carabiner
                loop - and if you don’t climb - simply use them for your keys.

                Making the world’s most indestructible pants is about more than one simple layer of anti-tear Dupont
                Teflon Coating.
                It’s about understanding how your body moves in extreme situations. It’s about the specialized
                3D-tailoring to ensure a
                free range of movement. It’s about the double-layer of material across the knee. It’s also about the
                anti-tear
                triangular section across the crotch.

                We tested hundreds of versions of SWAT Pants in the field, with a wide range of activities. <strong>This

Regular time spent crawling on your knees would ruin them. And if you have to suddenly jump into a river to retrieve a fish or rescue a friend, you’ll want to stay dry."
